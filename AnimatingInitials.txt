Animating Initial

When the system loads, the program will display translated ‘SG’ in-order to display the letters in the top right half of the screen and then it rotates the letters four full circles and then stopes at the initial point. 
Pressing the left, right, up and down key on the keyboard moves the shape ten units left, right, up and down respectively.  (I have used glutSpecialFunc(SpecialInput) call-back function to record user inputs from Arrow keys(????)
Pressing ‘s’ key on the keyboard scales up the letters and pressing ‘d’ shrinks the size in reference to fixed point (100,100).  
Pressing ‘c’, iterates the background colour.
Pressing ‘r’, rotates the shape clockwise around the origin and pressing ‘l’ rotates the shape anticlockwise.
